# Viz-Image-Classification

Deep Learning Based Data Visualization Image Classification

This repository contains the annotated dataset and labelled dataset. 

Labelled image dataset is easy version where each image related to sane class is in one folder

Annotated image  dataset google drive link is included. It has original and raw viper annotated files along with the corresponding
image file. So it is a messy version and interested partied would have to do the task of further divisions. Each image is annotated 
with the specific visual marks within the specific chart image. There might be redundancy that can be removed by the unique file 
name check.
